#!/bin/bash
# network-guard.sh — sandboxes Bash commands (network + file writes)
#
# Network modes:
#   sandbox (macOS): wraps Bash commands in sandbox-exec to block ALL outbound
#                    at kernel level. curl, python, compiled binaries, everything.
#   pattern (cross-platform): regex blocklist for weaponized network patterns
#   off: no network restrictions (pattern checks still run as defense-in-depth)
#
# File write sandbox (macOS, requires sandbox-exec):
#   Kernel-level restriction on which directories Bash can write to.
#   Covers all child processes (python, node, compiled binaries, etc.).
#   Works independently of network mode — if deny-write paths are set,
#   sandbox-exec is used even when network mode is "off" or "pattern".
#
# Env vars (set by dispatcher):
#   CLAUDE_GUARD_NETWORK_MODE: "sandbox" | "pattern" | "off"
#   CLAUDE_GUARD_SANDBOX_DENY_WRITE: colon-separated paths to block writes to
#   CLAUDE_GUARD_SANDBOX_ALLOW_WRITE: colon-separated exceptions within denied paths
